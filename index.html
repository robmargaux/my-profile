		<p>
			My name is Margaux, but some of my friends like to call me Robert or Ti Robert. I am a French girl passionated with travelling and discovering new cultures. I was born and I grew up on a French island located near Africa and Madagascar, called La Réunion. I am currently in my first master years, studying Digital Marketing in Lille, at IÉSEG.

		<h2>Voyages 🌎 🌍 🌏</h2>
		<p>
			I have done a few voyages with my family when I was a kid but later, I wanted to detached myslef from those very touristical types of travel. At age 14, I traveled to Madrid in Spain with my spanish class. We visited some much museum, I never tought I would have appreciated it, but I did 🤓.
			Then at 16, I went to Perth in Australia with other young people from my island to learn english. The journey was organised by a local association. I met wonderful people and drunk amazing smoothies! 🥝
			Finally at 19 years old, I went to Monterrey in Mexico for my exchange program in order to study and travel inside the country for one year! I really lived my best life there! 🇲🇽

			<h2>Animals 🐒</h2>
		<p>
			I love animals!! I have three cats at my parent's home and I am very strongly thinking about adopting a dog but my place is too small. Fun fact, as a kid, I wanted to become a veterinarian and reincarnate myself as a horse after my death.
